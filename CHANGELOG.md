# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

- panel: new **Status** page — supervised processes, mail queue, TLS
  certificate expiry, milter sockets and the server's own hostname/reverse-DNS
  (FCrDNS) check — and it is now the panel's landing page. The local checks
  refresh by polling; the DNS lookup is cached with a *Re-check* button.
- panel: the domain page shows a **DNS status** card: the published DKIM record
  compared against the key this server actually signs with, plus SPF and DMARC.
  The SPF check is deliberately shallow — it looks for a mechanism literally
  covering this server's address and does not follow `include:`/`redirect=`, so
  a record that authorises the server through an include is reported as "cannot
  tell", not as a failure.
- panel: the domain list moved from `/` to `/domains`; `/` redirects to the
  status page. The **Reload** button moved from the domain list to the status
  page and now explains what it regenerates and when to use it.
- fix: the panel could never read the mail queue in the documented deployment.
  `postqueue` relies on its setgid-`postdrop` bit, which `no-new-privileges`
  (set in the shipped compose file) disables, so the *Queue* screen always said
  "Could not read the mail queue". The `panel` user is now a real member of
  `postdrop`.
- panel: navigation bar is now rendered once from the shared layout, so every
  authenticated page has it — including the domain page and the delete
  confirmation, which had no navigation links at all — and the current page is
  highlighted instead of silently missing from the list.
- panel: new *Account* page to change the administrator's username and/or
  password (the current password is required, throttled on the same limiter as
  the login form). Changing the password invalidates all other sessions.
- panel: *Backup & migration* moved off the domain list onto its own *Backup*
  page, with the full backup and the domain import as two separate cards.
- panel: the domain page now shows the *Sending server settings* (server,
  port and encryption) needed to configure a mail client; port 587 is listed
  only when `SUBMISSION_ENABLE=true` for this deployment.
- panel: *Copy* buttons on the DKIM record, on a newly issued application
  login/password and on the sending server name.
- panel: the *Addresses* field is hidden while an application's address mode is
  *Any address of the domain*, where the server ignores it.
- ci: disable provenance attestation on release image push, so the ghcr.io
  manifest list shows only `linux/amd64`/`linux/arm64` (no `unknown/unknown`).
- security: optionally honour `X-Forwarded-For` for login/setup rate-limiting
  when the request's direct peer is in the new `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR` list,
  giving real per-client limits behind a reverse proxy instead of one global
  bucket. Unset by default (unchanged `RemoteAddr`-only behaviour).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

Initial feature-complete implementation of the v1.0 specification (phases 0-11
of `docs/implementation-plan.md`).

### Added

- Panel (Go, single static binary) with SQLite persistence, one-time
  crypto-random setup link, bcrypt admin auth, session cookies.
- Domain management with per-domain DKIM (RSA-2048, generated in pure Go) and
  OpenDKIM KeyTable/SigningTable regeneration + privilege-safe reload.
- Application (sender identity) management: SASL credentials via `sasldb2`,
  `smtpd_sender_login_maps` enforcing sender/domain ownership, no open relay.
- Full Postfix relay config generated from env at container start: SMTPS 465,
  optional STARTTLS submission 587, SASL auth, TLS for outbound delivery,
  anvil-based rate limiting (level 1).
- Journal milter (pure Go, `go-milter`) recording every send to `send_log`;
  fail-open by design so a milter fault never blocks mail.
- Monitoring UI: send log, Postfix queue, and mail.log tail, all
  HTMX-polling, HTML-escaped.
- Per-domain/per-application sending rate limit (level 2), enforced in the
  journal milter at `MAIL FROM`, fail-open on the limiter's own errors.
- Full backup/restore (`tar.gz` of `/data`, consistent SQLite snapshot via
  `VACUUM INTO`) with a version guard that refuses to start on a
  manifest/binary version mismatch. Per-domain export/import for moving a
  single domain between hosts without re-issuing DNS records.
- Deployment: Docker image + compose, reverse-proxy fragments for Apache
  (default), nginx, Caddy, and Traefik; CI workflow publishing tagged,
  multi-arch images to `ghcr.io` on `vX.Y.Z` tags.
- Security pass against spec 7.6 (exec safety, config-write sanitization,
  server-side validation, rate limiting, session/cookie hardening, output
  escaping, non-root panel) — full compliance, no code changes required.
- Live production deployment on `selfpost.mixfed.ru` with a real Let's
  Encrypt certificate; end-to-end delivery confirmed (DKIM pass, SPF pass).
