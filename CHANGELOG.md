# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

- ci: disable provenance attestation on release image push, so the ghcr.io
  manifest list shows only `linux/amd64`/`linux/arm64` (no `unknown/unknown`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

Initial feature-complete implementation of the v1.0 specification (phases 0-11
of `docs/implementation-plan.md`).

### Added

- Panel (Go, single static binary) with SQLite persistence, one-time
  crypto-random setup link, bcrypt admin auth, session cookies.
- Domain management with per-domain DKIM (RSA-2048, generated in pure Go) and
  OpenDKIM KeyTable/SigningTable regeneration + privilege-safe reload.
- Application (sender identity) management: SASL credentials via `sasldb2`,
  `smtpd_sender_login_maps` enforcing sender/domain ownership, no open relay.
- Full Postfix relay config generated from env at container start: SMTPS 465,
  optional STARTTLS submission 587, SASL auth, TLS for outbound delivery,
  anvil-based rate limiting (level 1).
- Journal milter (pure Go, `go-milter`) recording every send to `send_log`;
  fail-open by design so a milter fault never blocks mail.
- Monitoring UI: send log, Postfix queue, and mail.log tail, all
  HTMX-polling, HTML-escaped.
- Per-domain/per-application sending rate limit (level 2), enforced in the
  journal milter at `MAIL FROM`, fail-open on the limiter's own errors.
- Full backup/restore (`tar.gz` of `/data`, consistent SQLite snapshot via
  `VACUUM INTO`) with a version guard that refuses to start on a
  manifest/binary version mismatch. Per-domain export/import for moving a
  single domain between hosts without re-issuing DNS records.
- Deployment: Docker image + compose, reverse-proxy fragments for Apache
  (default), nginx, Caddy, and Traefik; CI workflow publishing tagged,
  multi-arch images to `ghcr.io` on `vX.Y.Z` tags.
- Security pass against spec 7.6 (exec safety, config-write sanitization,
  server-side validation, rate limiting, session/cookie hardening, output
  escaping, non-root panel) — full compliance, no code changes required.
- Live production deployment on `selfpost.mixfed.ru` with a real Let's
  Encrypt certificate; end-to-end delivery confirmed (DKIM pass, SPF pass).
